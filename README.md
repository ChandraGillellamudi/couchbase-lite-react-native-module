# overview
A reference implementation of a [React Native Module](https://reactnative.dev/docs/native-modules-intro) for couchbase lite on Android. 

In order to use Couchbase Lite as embedded database within your React Native app, you will need a way to access Couchbase Liteâ€™s native APIs from within your React Native JS application. React Native Modules allow mobile apps written in React Native to access native platform APIs.


The React Native Module example exports a subset of native Couchbase Lite API functionality. This is intended to be used as a reference. You can extend this module to expose other relevant APIs per [module development guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/native-modules-ios)
